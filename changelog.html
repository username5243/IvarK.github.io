          ETERNITY CHALLENGES<br>
          
          NEW TIME STUDIES<br>
          
          2 new achievement rows<br>
          
          Made certain news messages only show if you have reached certain levels of progression<br>
          
          Massively improved performance of calculating dimension costs thanks to SpectralFlame (cuts cpu usage by up to 2/3 in late-game)<br>
          
          New news (get it?) ticker entries<br>
          
          Added a production chart<br>

          Added new statistics to replace the scale statistic after 1e100000 antimatter<br>
          
          Added a new milestone for 30 eternities: "Start with all normal dimensions available for purchase".<br>
          
          Added an option to change the update rate of the game, ranging from 33ms to 200ms. (before this, it was locked at 50ms)<br>
          
          The game now partially simulates offline progress, instead of estimating it.<br>
          
          Added 3 new eternity upgrades.<br>
          
          Added a reward to the "NEW DIMENSIONS???" achievement, "Your achievement bonus affects Infinity Dimensions."<br>
          
          Buffed time study 111. (10 ^ (log10(antimatter) / 290 - 0.75)) > (10 ^ (log10(antimatter) / 285 - 0.75))<br>
          
          Buffed time study 83. (1.0001^x) > (1.0004^x)<br>
          
          Nerfed eternity upgrade 1. ((x+1)^3) > (x+1)<br>
          
          Nerfed eternity upgrade 2. (x^log4(2x)) > ((x/300)^log4(2x) with harsher formula above 125,000)<br>
          
          Fixed a bunch of bugs and changed a bunch of things. (more detail below)<br>
          
          Added buy max buttons to Time Dimensions and Time Theorems.<br>
          
          Added a hotkey for replicanti galaxies. (R)<br>
          
          <br>
          Nitty gritty:<br>
          
          Greatly improved the performance of calculating bonus tickspeed from time dimensions.<br>
          
          Replaced all references to soft resets with references to dimension boosts.<br>
          
          Made achievements update on import/hardreset.<br>
          
          Made the game take into account your infinity points gained on crunch for the purposes of eternity point gain when you eternity<br>
          
          The replicanti interval is now displayed after and reductions / increases.<br>
          
          Added missing periods to various achievements.<br>
          
          Made the bonus from time study 131 display next to max replicanti galaxies.<br>
          
          Added time dimensions to the info scale.<br>
          
          Changed the description of time study 31 to "Powers up bonuses that are based on your infinitied stat (to the power of 4)" from "Powers up existing upgrades based on infinitied stat (to the power of 4)"<br>
          
          Changed the description of "MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE" to say "Big Crunch with X" instead of "Reach X".<br>
          
          Added "with reduced effect" to the description of time study 71, 72, and 73.<br>
          
          Changed the text on autobuy max dimension boosts to "Buy max dimboosts every X seconds:" from "Max dimboost interval:". (to achieve parity with the autobuy max galaxies text)<br>
          
          Made the challenges button always show if you have more than 1 eternity.<br>
          
          Fixed centering issues with infinity and eternity upgrades.<br>
          
          Various minor changes to themes to improve consistency. (too minute to list, even here)<br>
          
          Made the eternity autobuyer number multiply by 5 when you buy the eternity point multiplier.<br>
          
          Increased the requirement for "Is This Hell?". (5 > 6.66 seconds)<br>
          
          Reduced the starting replicanti interval upgrade cost. (1e160 > 1e140)<br>
          
          Galaxies are labeled "Distant Antimatter Galaxies" when the cost scaling starts. (at 100 galaxies)<br>
          
          Dimensions no longer produce anything after reaching challenge goal, or after reaching infinity with fixed infinity. This is due to the c6 being abusable.<br>
          
          Made the 7 and 25 eternity milestones work much faster.<br>
          
          After unlocking bulk dimboosts, clicking dimension boost or pressing D will buy max dimension boosts.<br>
          
          Moved fake news, don't you dare to sleep, spreading cancer, and one for each dimension to rows 2, 3, 4, and 7 respectively.<br>
          
          Added a visual display of how many galaxies/dim boosts you have next to the cost.<br>
          
          Added an explanation of hotkeys to the options page.<br>
          
          Made shift+1-8 purchase singular dimensions and shift+T purchase a singular tickspeed upgrade.<br>
          
          Reworked the display of the buy time theorem buttons.<br>
          
          The milestones page now has 2 columns.<br>
          
          Extended support for standard notation to e3e18, and letter/cancer notation (almost) infinitely.<br>
          
          Added support for standard, letter and logrithm notation in autobuyer inputs.<br>
          
          Added "in a challenge" to the description of "Zero Deaths".<br>
          
          Made most large numbers in achievements be listed in your chosen notation.<br>
          
          Nerfed "Gift From The Gods"'s achievement reward.<br>
          
          Made purchasing time theorems with EP require at least 1 time dimension.<br>
          
          First eternity now takes you to the time dimensions tab.<br>
          
          Time dimension prices now have 2 decimal places.<br>
          
          Reformatted the tick interval reduction text for very small numbers.<br>
          
          The game now keeps track of when you automatically do an infinity, and you can passively gain IP based off the IP/min in that run if you go offline (but only if infinity isn't broken).<br>
          
          Made time study 171 apply retroactively. This was causing an issue with production being much lower than expected when going into a long run on the same run as respeccing.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where max all wasn't giving achievements when buying dimensions.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where eternity milestone classes weren't set correctly upon import.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the eternity autobuyer, sacrifice autobuyer, time dimension tab, and replicanti wasn't hiding correctly upon import.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where buy max dim boosts was able to buy 1 too many boosts.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the game wouldn't show the default dimensions tab upon hard resetting.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where time dimensions were called "X Dimension" rather than "X Time Dimension".<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the replicanti galaxy button would show as locked if you had more than the listed max replicanti galaxies and study 131.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the last ten eternities average said IP/X rather than EP/X.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the big crunch autobuyer said "X times since last crunch" instead of "X times last crunch".<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the challenge records display wouldn't update upon import.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where hotkeys wouldn't work sometimes.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where secret theme names would display as "0" after refreshing.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where time studies would move around when your window size was too small.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where infinity dimensions would reset when clicking on a challenge and not entering while challenge confirmations were on.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where you always had the infinity challenge 1 reward.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the study tree would be off-centered if the game windows wasn't wide enough.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where you could buy factions of dimension boosts with dimension boost bulk buy.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where your autobuy max dimension boost interval would set itself to itself if you eternitied while changing it it.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where secondary statistic tabs weren't hiding upon import.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where replicanti galaxies wouldn't give a bonus if you had less than 3 galaxies.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the dimension boost autobuyer would ignore dimension boost costs until they costed 8th dimensions.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the future shop multipliers were displayed before the x rather than after.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the challenge confirmation button's off and on were lowercase.<br>
          
          Fixed a bug where the static infinity point display would disappear after eternity.<br>
